# Nozzle

Nozzle is the place where the ion particles are generated and accelerated. Unlike chemical rocket engines, we don't need to handle high pressure and high temperature.

There are 3 major components in the nozzle, anode, cathode, and a electromagnet coil.

## Anode

It's a 1-inch to 3/4-inch cooper coupling, with a stainless-steel clamp around it to secure the wires.

## Cathode

To maximize the hollow cathode effect, we need a long and thin metal tube. One choice is a ball pump needle. One end can connect to the tube from air pump. The open end is where the propellant comes out.

## Electromagnet

The electromagnet is a low current coil. Build a coil from scratch takes time, so we bought a car air conditioner compressor clutch coil. Its size and magnetic intensity fit our scenario.

## Case

All these components are installed into a case. Here is a 3D model of it. It can be contructed by 3D printing or cardboard.
