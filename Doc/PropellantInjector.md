# Propellant Injector

Currently we are using air as the propellant. So, the injector is just an air compressor or pump. Here a cheap fish tank air pump is used for this purpose. It takes 120V AC electric supply, and it's always on. In the future, it'll be modified to take a DC 12V power source, and switched by control subsystem.

**Status**: Done.

## Alternative Design

Another solution is taking a liquid nitrogen tank as the gas source, and have a controllable switch to turn it on and off.
