# Power Module

The power module contains 3 parts. They'll be explained below.

## DC Power Source

The first part is a 12V DC power source. Currently an ATX power supply unit from an old computer is used. Along with a board to turn the power unit on and off. It's easy to find these pieces online. It'll be replaced by a 12V battery in the future.

**Status**: Done.

## ZVS Driver

A ZVS driver is a circuit that can oscillate a large amount of DC power with very high efficiency. This design here is a well known one, invented by Vladimiro Mazzilli.

It's also a finished board that can be found online. The output of this board is connected to a 5+5:10 homemade toroid transformer. It doesn't change the voltage, but isolate the two sides. On the primary coil side, the ZVS can keep oscillating. Meanwhile on the secondary coil side, it pumps the power to the successor circuit. The transformer is made from a FT240-61 ferrite core. Each of its coil has a inductance of 27uH.

## Power Switch

The DC from power source and AC from ZVS driver are separated into multiple channels. One to capacitor bank, one to starter, and one to electromagnet coil. When the ControlSignal is low level, the capacitor bank channel is on, other two ones are switched off.

Since the output to starter and capacitor bank are AC, a regular triac-based solid state relay also doesn't work here. Triac is not able to be turned off by cut off the signal. Instead, here we use 2 MOSFETs connected back-to-back to act as an AC solid state switch. The output to electromagnet coil is DC, just one MOSFET is enough.

The circuit is hand soldered on a prototyping board.

## Calculations

The resonant frequency of ZVS driver is detemined by its LC circuit.

`f = 1 / (2 * PI * sqrt(L * C))`

L is the primary coil of T1. It's measured as 27uH. And C here is 0.66uF. Put them into the equation, we have,

`f = 1 / (2 * PI * sqrt(0.000027 * 0.00000066)) = 37.7 kHz`

The impedance of the L is,

`X = 2 * PI * f * L = 2 * PI * 37700 * 0.000027 = 6.39 Î©`

**Status**: Done.
